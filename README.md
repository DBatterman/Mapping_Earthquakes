# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

Using Leaflet, we have created a multi-layered map to display earthquakes that have happened over the past seven days. We can see how strong the earthquakes are based on the radius and colors of the points. There is also a filter to display the fault lines, and any earthquakes with magnitude 4.5 or above.
